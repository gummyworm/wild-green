Today I worked on a few items for the GUI.
Here's a lil' list:
- improve border/background drawing
- add onAccept to the console widget to accept entities
- add backgrounds to PRG's names to make them more visible
- removed Z-layer setting from the GUI manager (to allow widgets the flexibility
  to place themselves.
- another Z-layer change: PRGs now have a low Z level so that windows are drawn
  on top of them.
- added a texture font for windows and position the title based on its measured
  dimension
- added an optional thumbnail to entities (for now used by the Shepard PRG to
  draw a thumbnail of the representative entities.

Over the last weekend I worked a lot on the "Shepard" PRG.  This is a convienient
means to command one's units.  I'm quite happy with the progress I made on it,
so I'm looking forward to spending some more time tomorrow on improvements to
it.
Some ideas I'm bouncing around:
- ways to give detailed commands (besides movement) via the Shepard.
- more detailed information about the entities (health, etc.)

After I have my fun with that, I think I'll try adding an enemy or two and see
if I can start mocking up some combat.  That will be a kind of long, but fun
process.  I imagine that will take me through the weekend.

On a personal note, I'm really trying to get back into a regular exercise
routine.  I'm so goddanged stressed lately, and I feel like a lot of it is
due to my lack of healthy routine habits.  Off to a good start, so I intend to
keep it up.
