Well, I didn't really get anything done yesterday as I was at a local brewery
playing trivia with my brother.  Today I worked on a couple miscellaneous
items related to the "shepard" widget (as I previously mentioned).
- add icons to AI patterns (to be used to show the directives of the player's units)
- added optional colored rendering to the thumbnails based on the entity's current HP

I also added an AI pattern to perform an action when it enters the radius of a
given entity.  That will serve as the basis for combat, which I'll hopefully
get a start on tomorrow.

Alrighty, pretty empty day, but oh well.
